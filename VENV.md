# Virtual Environment Migration
  We have detected that you were using a legacy virtual environment in this repl.
  As we upgrade our infrastructure, legacy virtual environments generated by older Repls are no longer supported.
  We have deactivated it and moved it to `venv (deactivated)`, and upgraded your `.replit` and `replit.nix` files to use the new infrastructure.
  
  ### Bug Fixes
  - If you are missing any python dependencies, you can reinstall them using `upm add <package>`.
  - If you created a custom virtual environment, you can create a new one without issue.
  The old one is still available in `venv (deactivated)` for reference, however it may contain broken symlinks preventing you from using it directly.
  - If you have any other issues that you believe are related to this migration, please contact support.
